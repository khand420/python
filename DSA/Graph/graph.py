 # -----------Graph Data Structure------------

# Graphs are complex, non-linear data structures that are characterized by a group of vertices, connected by edges.
# Graph theory examples are: Google Map, Yahoo Map, Gps 


# Some Termonology used on graph

# 1. Vertex->  are the nodes of the graph
# 2. Edges ->  path between two vertexes
# 3. Degree->  count the no of connected vertex of same edges or a neibour vertex
# 4. Path->    sequence of edges between two vertex. for example:- find a path A TO E in a Pentagonal. A->B, B->C, C-E.
# 5. Connected Graph-> when two vertex connected with a edge are said to be connected graph
#                     * Minimum no of edges needed in a connected graph is = (n-1)          ....where, n = no of vertex
#                     * Maximum no of edges needed in a connected graph is = nC2 = n(n-1)/2
